# üìù Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Title:

**Audit Logging Implementation for Django Application**

## Purpose:

The purpose of this implementation is to introduce an audit logging system to track and store all relevant user and system actions within the Django application. This will improve accountability, traceability, and compliance with data policies.

---

## Scope:

This feature will log actions such as create, update, delete, login/logout, permission changes, and other critical user actions.

---

## Goals:

* Capture who did what, when, and from where.
* Store audit data in a secure and queryable format.
* Allow admin/staff users to view logs in a dashboard or export them.
* Ensure minimal performance overhead on application runtime.

---

## Non-Goals:

* Real-time alerting on user actions (future enhancement).
* External logging systems integration like ELK/Datadog (out of scope for now).

---

## Functional Requirements:

| ID  | Requirement                                                  | Priority |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| FR1 | Log all CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE operations on selected models | High     |
| FR2 | Log user LOGIN and LOGOUT events                             | High     |
| FR3 | Store metadata like user ID, IP, timestamp, and action       | High     |
| FR4 | Provide admin view to filter/search audit logs               | Medium   |
| FR5 | Enable exporting audit logs as CSV/Excel                     | Medium   |
| FR6 | Restrict log visibility to superusers or admin staff         | High     |

---

## Technical Requirements:

* Use a dedicated Django model/table for storing audit logs.
* Use Django middleware and signals (`post_save`, `post_delete`, etc.)
* Consider `django-simple-history`, `django-auditlog`, or a custom implementation.
* Implement pagination and filtering in the admin dashboard.

---

## Task Breakdown by Module

### 1. üîß **Audit Log Data Model**

* [ ] Create an `AuditLog` model with fields:

  * `user`, `ip_address`, `action`, `model`, `object_id`, `changes`, `timestamp`
* [ ] Set up `__str__`, indexing, and admin registration.

### 2. üõ† **Signal Handlers for CRUD Events**

* [ ] Connect `post_save` and `post_delete` signals to key models.
* [ ] Log changes (field-wise differences for updates).
* [ ] Store object representation (optional: JSON snapshot).

### 3. üîí **Authentication Event Logging**

* [ ] Add custom login/logout signals or override login/logout views.
* [ ] Capture user, timestamp, and IP.

### 4. üåê **Middleware to Capture IP Address**

* [ ] Add middleware to attach IP address to `request`.
* [ ] Store IP address in thread-local storage or directly into audit log.

### 5. üßë‚Äçüíª **Admin/Staff Audit Log Dashboard**

* [ ] Create a secured view (`@staff_member_required`).
* [ ] List view with pagination, filters (user, date, model, action).
* [ ] Detail view to inspect change data.

### 6. üì§ **Export Logs Feature**

* [ ] Add export to CSV functionality (via Django admin or custom view).
* [ ] Use `pandas`, `csv`, or `django-import-export`.

### 7. üß™ **Testing**

* [ ] Unit tests for model and signals.
* [ ] Integration tests for dashboard and exports.
* [ ] Test performance on large datasets.

### 8. üìö **Documentation & Deployment**

* [ ] Update README/docs on how logging works.
* [ ] Add migrations and deploy safely.
* [ ] Add sample log records and testing scripts for QA.
